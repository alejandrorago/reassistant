In this page you will find instructions to install and execute REAssistant.

= Details =

REAssitant is composed of several eclipse plugins. Those eclipse plugins have been implemented using the latest version to-date of eclipse = Eclipse v3.7 "Indigo" SR2.

The first step is to download a fresh version of Eclipse 3.7 SR2, and install the following "dependant" plugins. To do that, in Eclipse, click Help > Install New Software. Then, add the following _Update Sites_ and install them.

WindowBuilder Pro - http://dl.google.com/eclipse/inst/d2wbpro/latest/3.7
EMF Query2 - https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/tycho-query2-nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/targetPlatform/
UIMA - http://www.apache.org/dist/uima/eclipse-update-site/

Second, copy its *REAssistant plugin* jars (downloaded from the *Downloads* page) into the _plugins_ folder of eclipse.

Finally, download the _REAssistant models_ (downloaded from the *Downloads* page), uncompress them into a folder, and modify the eclipse ini file adding the following environment variable:
MODELS_PATH=C:/Your/Path/REAssistant-models/ at _eclipse.ini_

This way, we link the variable to the models folder.

That's it, you now can execute and use REAssistant at your pc / mac.
