#summary Explanation of REAssistant crosscutting visualizations.

= Crosscutting visualizations =

REAssistant helps analysts to analyze the effects of crosscutting concerns over requirements using two views. These two views are the global and detailed visualization, which provide insights of crosscutting behavior at different levels.

== Global visualization ==

The global view shows a comprehensive outlook of crosscutting concerns over all the documents. In this view we can only see approximate places in which crosscutting concerns affect the documents, but not the text involved.

== Detailed visualization ==

The detailed view shows a low level visualization, targetting a single document. Moreover, in this view we can appreciate the text affected by each crosscutting concern.
